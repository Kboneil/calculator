# Weekend Challenge 3

This "Calculator" repo was created to practice using express. The input must be sent into the server and then to a router that does the calculations. Finally, the total is sent back to the client and appended to the DOM.

## Features

The user can input any number and either add, subtract, multiply or divide. There is also a clear feature that empties out the last answer.
